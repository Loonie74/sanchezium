Installing Sanchezium

To install GUI wallet for Windows or Linux (Ubuntu 14.04), download it from http://sanchezium.com

If you want to use Windows wallet, just run it.

If you want to use Linux wallet, double-click downloaded .deb package and follow the installer instructions. After the installation is complete, you can find your wallet in the applications menu.

To install server application for VPS, execute following commands as user:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install git build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev libssl-dev libdb++-dev libminiupnpc-dev

git clone https://github.com/sanchezium/sanchezium.git

You don't need to compile the server application, it's already included in the repository and will be located in the ~/sanchezium/src folder.

To run it, navigate to ~/sanchezium/src and execute command ./Sancheziumd

If server applicatiun gets stuck with message "Sanchezium server starting..." or like that, just press Ctrl-C, it's normal.
